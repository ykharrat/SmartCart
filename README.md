# Final Project Starter Repository

This is the starter repository for the ENGR 029 final project. You can get started using it the same way as previous labs; the only code in the repository is the blinky example.

This repository uses the bare metal profile; if you need the full profile (see [here](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.16/bare-metal/index.html) for help deciding), open `mbed_app.json` and delete the line that says: `    "requires": ["bare-metal"],`.
